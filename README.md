# CVE-2022-22954

This package detects a subset of
[CVE-2022-22954](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-22954) attempts and
exploits, generates a notice, and also includes the exploit URI and the first
4KB of the data that was sent back to the attacker as a response. While
detecting this attack is more straightforward from [log analysis](#), this
package helps by logging the response sent back to the attacker to aid in
incidence response.
